# twilio_opportunities  
This is an application utilizing a [headless Chrome driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started), operated by [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) to automate scanning of new opportunities.    
If you have any questions, or need any assistance with the this app, job hunting, interview, or application process, please do not hesitate to [reach out](https://jper.me/).
While this application mainly targets Twilio (hello Twilions!), it can be modified for other companies listing positions on Greenhouse as well. Currently, it is set to run every morning at 8:00 (AM, local timezone.)  
Based off of the keywords, blacklist, and locations, it will utilize Twilio's programmable SMS to text you found positions.
